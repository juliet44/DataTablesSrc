<title>Ajax sourced data</title>

<info><![CDATA[

DataTables can read data from a server via Ajax, while still performing searching, ordering, paging etc on the client-side. This is done through use of the `dt-init ajax` option, which has a number of options to customise how the data is retrieved from the server.

The examples in this section demonstrate the use of Ajax loading data in DataTables, with client-side processing.
